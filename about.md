I'm David Shepherd, currently a software engineer at [Biosite Systems](http://www.biositesystems.co.uk/).

Previously I worked as a research assistant at the University of Manchester where I looked at using machine learning techniques to recognise electromagnetic signals for AWE, and at scheduling algorithms for scientific computing in the cloud.

Prior to that I was a PhD student at the University of Manchester doing research on computational methods for micromagnetics.
