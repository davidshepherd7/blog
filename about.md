I'm David Shepherd, currently a software engineer building financial infrastructure in Africa at [Wave](http://wave.com/en).

Previously I worked at [Biosite Systems](http://www.biositesystems.co.uk/).

Before that I was at the University of Manchester where I did research on
computational methods for micromagnetics, machine learning techniques for
recognising electromagnetic signals, and scheduling algorithms for scientific
computing in the cloud.

Get in touch at `[my name, no spaces or anything]7@gmail.com`.
