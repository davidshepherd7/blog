I'm David Nikel-Shepherd, a software engineer building financial infrastructure
in Africa at [Wave](http://wave.com/en). I wrote more about Wave
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/writing-about-my-job.html).

Previously I worked at [Biosite Systems](http://www.biositesystems.co.uk/).

Before that I was at the University of Manchester where I did research on
computational methods for micromagnetics, machine learning techniques for
recognising electromagnetic signals, and scheduling algorithms for scientific
computing in the cloud.
