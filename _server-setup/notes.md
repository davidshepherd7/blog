Later:

* Register techtrickery.com again https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/domains/home?region=us-east-1#/DomainSearch?domainName=techtrickery.com
* SSL/certbot
* Check that unattended upgrades worked (i.e. no pending security updates)
* Turn off the old VM (once the uptime robot people have had a chance to debug if they want)
